# TimeLockx

## Project Description
TimeLockx is a decentralized smart contract that enables users to securely lock their ETH for a specified duration. Once locked, the funds cannot be withdrawn until the lock period has expired. This ensures disciplined saving, delayed payments, and transparent fund handling.

## Project Vision
The vision of TimeLockx is to provide a **trustless, transparent, and secure** way for users to lock funds on the Ethereum blockchain. By eliminating intermediaries, it ensures that locked funds are only accessible after the chosen time period.

## Key Features
- **Lock Funds:** Users can lock ETH for a customizable duration.
- **Automatic Time Enforcement:** Funds cannot be accessed until the lock duration has expired.
- **Secure Withdrawals:** Users can withdraw only after the unlock time.
- **Transparency:** Anyone can view lock details publicly on-chain.

## Future Scope
- Support for ERC20 tokens in addition to ETH.
- Multi-user vaults for collaborative time-locked savings.
- Advanced features like recurring locks and penalty withdrawals.
- Integration with DeFi protocols for earning yield while funds are locked.
